3.Canvas: The <canvas> element allows for dynamic rendering of graphics and animations using JavaScript. This feature is crucial for web applications that require real-time graphical rendering, interactive games, data visualization, and more.

4.Local Storage: HTML5 introduced the localStorage and sessionStorage APIs, enabling web applications to store data locally on the user's device. This feature improves offline capabilities, application speed, and responsiveness by reducing the need for frequent server requests.
